  ## Installation
  Run an npm i. The necessary dependencies should be in the JSON. However, the app is also live and you should be able to use it without any installs or having the code if you would like. You will need a .env if you wish to use the code.

  ## Usage
  Search for any city and see the weather. It will help you decide what to wear, how to prepare for your day and various activities, etc.

  ## Contributing
  I used the starter code given to me. Contributions should go through the coding bootcamp.

  ## Tests
  Not currently functioning. The API route is working just fine and retrieving data, but it won't display properly. Test little bits to see if you can get things working right.
